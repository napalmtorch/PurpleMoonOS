# PurpleMoonOS
Operating system built from "scratch" in C#, using Cosmos Kernel

In order to login, you must use the Filesystem.vdmk file included. It contains a file named "config.pmc" that has the login data.
Place it in "C:\Users\*YOUR_USER_NAME*\AppData\Roaming\Cosmos User Kit\Build\VMware\Workstation\"

This operating system may look nice, but it contains some bugs resulting in the OS crashing and halting. Not sure exactly why
but I think it has to do something with my Window Manager, as it usually happens when manipulating Windows. Could be a memory leak, 
feel free to try and fix it!
